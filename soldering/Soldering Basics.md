## Soldering and Basic Electronics Safety

### Synopsis
In this training you will learn about soldering. Soon, you will understand how it has been used to make many of the electronic devices people have enjoyed for decades. Although many handheld electronics used today are assembled by machines, people still use soldering for a variety of electronic applications.

### Prerequisites
A basic understanding of electronics is useful but not required.

### Objectives
By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
* Select the proper tools and solder
* Identify the resistance of a resistor
* Identify the capacitance of a capacitor
* Describe best practices of soldering electronics to a circuit board

### Required Tools
* Solder Station + Iron
* Wet Sponge
* Wire Stripper
* Solder
* Capacitors: 0.1 uF (2), 0.01uF (2)
* Resistors: 600 Ohm (3), 1 Meg Ohm (3), 120 K Ohm (3)
* Circuit Board
* 9v Battery and Clip
* 1 x Light Emitting Diode
* Helping Hand

### General Safety
* You may want to use safety glasses. Eye protection is a good idea when working with anything that might get into you eyes (e.g. chemicals, metal shards, or sawdust).
* Always assume the soldering iron is *HOT*. The tip can get very hot, and won’t be red. You can easily burn yourself if not careful.
* Never leave a soldering iron unattended when plugged in (i.e. when turned on).
* Use a fire resistant surface when soldering.

### What is Soldering?
Soldering is the process of connecting two or more components (usually metal) by melting a separate metal alloy, called solder, over the joined pieces.The molten solder coats the components, cools, then hardens. It’s similar to working with glue.


### Tinning
Tinning is a technique used to help melt the connector contacts (i.e. wires) together. Tinning is simply the process of melting a coat of solder on the tip of your iron, and electronic components. This additional coat not only makes the soldering process easier, it fills gaps within the wires, and creates sturdy connections.

Here is a video that describes the tinning process.

### Solder Types

Solder comes in a variety of sizes, and chemical makeup. It’s important to have the right type of solder.

Size matters, when it comes to solder. The thickness of the wire and electrical components will determine the thickness of solder needed. But, one good rule of thumb is to use thin solder when working with small components; somewhere in the range of 0.02” to 0.04” (0.5mm to 1mm) in diameter.

### Clean Up & Maintenance
* Before leaving your station, make sure the area is clean, and solder iron is off.
* The safest measure, unplug your soldering iron.
